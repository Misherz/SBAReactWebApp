### How It Works
**Fetching Data:** The app retrieves the latest articles using the `getData` function, which interacts with the API.

**Displaying Articles:** After the data is retrieved, the articles are presented in a clear and organized layout. Users can view the title, description, content, and have the option to read the full article via a link.

**Handling Missing or Removed Articles:** We make sure that articles marked as [Removed] are not displayed, which enhances the overall quality and relevance of the content.
